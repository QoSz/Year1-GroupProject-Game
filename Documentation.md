# Python-The-Pyscho-Murderer-On-The-Loose

This is a text-based murder-mystery game designed with python 3. Created for team 15's group assessment!
This idea came about through the combined efforts of the team, and we all agreed to do a murder mystery game.
This is a game set in 1920 and the player's objective is to find the psycho murderer who assassinated the Queen.


# Requirements 

Modern PC/Laptop
Python 3 or higher
and atleast 20MB of storage space

The game has a music background(and the options to play/stop music) that works ONLY on Windows.
 
If you play the game on other systems like Linux or MacOS it will work fine, but there won't be any music background(nor the options to play/stop music).

For the music background to work, the music file must be in the same folder as the game.py
